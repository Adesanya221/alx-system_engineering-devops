To answer this question in a simple and detailed manner, lets take a look at this word called server, which we would use alot in this article

What’s a Server?
A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. This architecture is called the client–server model.

The client-server model
The client is typically the ‘thing’ requesting information . Typically clients are the web user’s internet-connected devices, such our computer, laptop or phone connected to Wi-Fi or mobile network — and web-accessing software available on those devices or browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari. In our example, the client is in fact the browser and the device we are using to type in www.google.com

Server is the ‘thing’ sending or serving information to the client. They store webpages, sites, or apps. In our example, it would be the google server.

When a client device wants to access a webpage, it requests a copy of the webpage from the server which is then downloaded onto the client to be displayed in the user’s web browser.
